# dicom2raw
---
This is a simple script for converting dozens of `.dcm` slices to a single `.raw` file.

Modify the `dicomPath` to the parent directory of your `.dcm` files (only `.dcm` files would be processed, no warry about other file types).
Then run the script, an `all_in_one.raw` file would be generated!
